    <h3>THIS IS TRULY PASTURE RAISED CHICKEN</h3>
    <p>
      Our birds are raised outside on pasture 24/7/365 where they can forage for
      grasses, bugs, seeds, and worms. They move to fresh pasture every single
      day, and we've never given them a single antibiotic or drug.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're a family farm that believes in the regenerative power of pasture
      raised livestock for land, animal, and community. The end result is
      chicken thatâ€™s rich with old school flavor, nutrient dense, and
      environmentally responsible.
